# Opsgility-Training-Wiki

This repository is for trainers of Opsgility to share lessons learned and resource documentation that they have gained through delivery of a course.

We would like this to be a helpful knowledgebase for everyone to be able to provide a high value experience to our students and avoid duplication of issues that others have seen in previous classes.

Items to include, for example, could include:
- Links to resources that were helpful to share with the class for exam preparation reference
- Remembering to remind students to deploy some of the labs ahead of time to allow for environments to spin up
- Lessons learned and feedback from students regarding the flow of the course
- "Gotchas" when delivering a course, such as changes to the Azure portal that may need to be updated in the courseware or labs
- Any other thoughts that you feel would be helpful for other course trainers...

This repository is meant to be helpful to trainers and NOT a location to air compliants and grievances regarding content.  Positive and helpful content ONLY!  Thank you.
